# Cenote Examples

---

This directory exists for working demonstration of individual Cenote components.

Examples should be a self-contained, runnable typescript file that showcases a specific feature, functionality, series, workflow, etc.

Code should be obvious, and easy to follow with minimal comments and reduced complexity.
