# Tests

---

- All sample data should be placed in `src/tests/fixtures/`.
- All mocks should be placed in `src/tests/mocks/`.
- All test files should be placed in `src/tests/` and follow the naming convention `*.test.ts`.
- All tests should use the `describe` and `it` syntax from Deno's testing library.
- All tests should use the standard `assert` module from Deno.
- All tests should only be unit tests, integration tests are out of scope for this project.
