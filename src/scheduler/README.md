# Scheduler

Handles timing & triggers.

---

- Could start simple with cron-like intervals, expand into:
  - Event-driven triggers (e.g., "new RSS item -> parse immediately").
  - AI-directed scheduling (the brain deciding to "check site X every hour").
- Coordinates with `brain` to start jobs at the right time.
